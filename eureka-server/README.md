# Eureka Server

This project is a **Spring Cloud Eureka Server** implementation, providing a **Service Discovery** solution for microservices architectures. Eureka Server serves as a registry where different microservices can register themselves and discover each other without hardcoding their locations. By centralizing service registration, Eureka enables dynamic scaling, load balancing, and fault tolerance within a microservices ecosystem.

## Purpose
The purpose of this Eureka Server project is to:
- Provide a **centralized service registry** for microservices, enabling them to dynamically locate and interact with each other.
- Enhance **fault tolerance** by allowing services to register and deregister themselves, making it easy to scale in or out as needed.
- Enable **load balancing** and **client-side routing**, as clients can discover multiple instances of a service and distribute requests accordingly.

## How It Works
1. **Service Registration:** Microservices register with the Eureka Server on startup, specifying their unique service names.
2. **Heartbeat:** Each registered service periodically sends a heartbeat to the Eureka Server, ensuring it remains listed in the registry.
3. **Service Discovery:** Microservices can query the Eureka Server to obtain addresses of other services, facilitating inter-service communication.

## Features
- **Service Discovery**: Allows services to find each other without hardcoded addresses.
- **Dynamic Scaling**: Services can register and deregister as they scale in or out.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Eureka Server marks services as "DOWN" if they fail to send heartbeats within a specified time.
- **Load Balancing Compatibility**: Works well with Ribbon, Feign, or other load balancing libraries.

3. Access the Eureka Dashboard at [http://localhost:8761](http://localhost:8761) (default port).

## Configuration
Eureka Server can be configured in `application.yml`:
- **eureka.instance.hostname**: Set the hostname for the Eureka Server.
- **eureka.client.register-with-eureka**: Set to `false` to prevent the server from registering with itself.
- **eureka.client.fetch-registry**: Set to `false` as the server does not need to query its own registry.

## Usage
### Registering Services
Microservices must include the following configuration in their `application.yml` or `application.properties`:
```yaml
eureka:
  client:
    service-url:
      defaultZone: http://localhost:8761/eureka/
```

### Accessing Registered Services
Microservices can now use the Eureka client to discover registered services:
```java
@Autowired
private DiscoveryClient discoveryClient;

public List<ServiceInstance> getServiceInstances(String serviceName) {
    return discoveryClient.getInstances(serviceName);
}
```
